In this simulation, I am going to be working with the Colorado board of elections in  election audit for U.S congressional precinct. My task for this job is to report the following tasks; total number of votes, total number of votes and percentage for each candidate, and winner of election.

This is making the vote count to be automatic. This could be used for any election in the future that uses the popular vote. There could be modification with to use this for the electoral college vote. This would be calculate the popular party that would elect the President.
